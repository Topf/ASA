Looking at your code, I can see you already have `model_id="anthropic/claude-4"` on line 38. However, there are a few things to consider about using Claude-4:

Based on the search results, I can see that Claude-4 **is indeed available** through LiteLLM! Here's what you need to know:

## Claude-4 Availability and Model IDs

According to the LiteLLM documentation, Claude-4 has been released with two variants:

1. **Claude Opus 4** - `claude-opus-4-20250514` (most capable)
2. **Claude Sonnet 4** - `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (high-performance)

## What You Need to Do

Your current configuration is almost correct, but you need to update the model ID. Here's what you should change:

## Model Options

You have two Claude-4 options to choose from:

1. **Claude Opus 4** (`claude-opus-4-20250514`) - Most capable and intelligent
2. **Claude Sonnet 4** (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) - High-performance with exceptional reasoning

I've updated your code to use **Claude Opus 4** since it's the most capable model. If you prefer the high-performance variant instead, you can change it to:

```python
model_id="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
```

## Additional Notes

- Both models support text and image input
- 200k context window
- Your existing API key and configuration should work fine
- The pricing for Claude Opus 4 is $15/MTok for input and $75/MTok for output
- Claude Sonnet 4 is more cost-effective at $3/MTok for input and $15/MTok for output

Your code should now work with the latest Claude-4 model! The rest of your configuration looks correct.
